My therapeutic approach is caring, interactive and direct, and draws on my experience with both psychological, practical, and spiritual approaches to growth and development. Depending on a person's individual needs I use a combination of talk therapy, skills practice, awareness exercises, visualization, and honest reflection to help them achieve their personal goals. I work with people on a variety of topics and my areas of particular specialty include: couples counseling, helping men show up more fully in life, work, and relationships, and helping both men and women better identify, value, and communicate their needs & boundaries. Along with my expertise, I bring my heart, my humor, and my own life experiences as a man, husband, and father to my practice. I enjoy working with people from all kinds of backgrounds and lifestyles.",

I consider uncovering emotions and meaning important for change. I can help with destructive patterns and nagging trauma.

I believe in treating each person as a unique individual and together finding the best way toward wellbeing. This begins with a comprehensive evaluation which can last from one to four sessions where we will attempt to understand the current difficulties and discuss treatment options. I have experience treating a wide variety of psychological and emotional difficulties with psychotherapy and medication when appropriate. In my practice I offer psychotherapy and medication evaluation/management to patients who are already in therapy. I have training in several modalities of psychotherapy including Psychodynamic, Interpersonal, and Emotionally Focused Couples/Family Therapy. I aim to help clients be present to their emotional experiences and develop insight into their psychological functioning. I have a special interest in women's mental health, particularly issues around pregnancy and motherhood. I have experience and training working with women who have mental illness and are or are considering becoming pregnant.",

CAREGIVER BURNOUT: More than 65,000,000 family caregivers are providing care to an ill, aged, or disabled spouse, child or friend. A big mistake caregivers make is to neglect their own physical and emotional needs. Don't forget to care for yourself when you are caring for someone else.",

I work interactively and collaboratively to support you at your pace while helping you move toward the fullest expression of the life you wish to lead. I provide a safe holding environment where the changes you hope for can occur. The therapeutic relationship is the backdrop for investigation and integration, with openness, curiosity, and tenderness. With greater awareness and non-judgement, your capacity for self-acceptance expands. Ultimately this extends out to others in your life and propels you into a more satisfying and harmonious existence. In my work with families, I focus on strengthening the parent-child relationship. I provide developmental guidance and help attach new meanings to behavior, helping parents find new ways of responding and relating to their children. In my work with adults, I help individuals participate more fully in their life's unfolding by making more conscious choices to embody the life they wish to lead.",

I am a calm and grounded person, and this makes my clients feel supported and safe. My work as a therapist is supported by training in the Hakomi method, as well as my life experience and 40 years of Buddhist practice. I will support you in developing greater self-awareness as well as balance of body-mind-spirit. You may find yourself stuck in old patterns, following familiar paths that no longer lead where you want to go. New paths may be less familiar and more work, requiring you to clear away rocks and branches. It can be helpful to have a guide - someone who is holding the map, the flashlight, and who has your back. I can be that guide, supporting you in moving along new paths. New paths can lead to improved relationships, greater self esteem, reduced anxiety, and healing from trauma. Our work can bring more satisfaction and enjoyment into your life. Feel free to contact me for a brief initial phone consultation. I see clients during the week and on Saturdays.",

I might help you to: Discover and release emotional and relational wounds; Alleviate depression, hopelessness, anxiety or mood instability; Face life transitions in employment, relationships, health or aging; Deal with loss and grief; Resolve issues with drug and alcohol dependence; Navigate parenting issues from infancy through young adulthood; Develop more satisfying communication and intimacy in relationships and deepen your relationship with yourself, emerging from dissatisfaction to find fulfillment. I can help you heal the tendency toward self-criticism and blame that is an obstacle to your growth. Your innate capacities for love, joy, intimacy, courage and strength can emerge once emotional injuries are given kind attention and room for change in the therapeutic relationship. I love seeing both individuals and couples. I am trained in depth and relational psychology, and have practiced psychotherapy in San Francisco for 25 years. My work is also informed by meditation; as a student of the Diamond Approach; and a parent for 28 years. I welcome people of any gender and sexual orientation.",

I see my role as both collaborator and guide, bearing witness to my client's stories and helping grow insight so new, more empowering stories might be written. I do this using several techniques including changing maladaptive, deeply ingrained thinking/feeling/behavior patterns, and exploring challenging childhood, family, and relationship history. I have experience treating issues of anxiety, depression, destructive relationship patterns, and clients with painful spiritual experiences they want assistance healing. While I have a range of experience, my specialty involves work with individual, single adults who have experienced trauma or challenge in their dating lives and/or carry pain associated with the unmet desire to be married. This starting point often leads to deep exploration of family and childhood history.",

How you respond to these emotions is what makes all the difference and can dictate whether you sink and struggle or thrive and grow. Amazingly, it is by facing and bringing love to what you wish you could 'get rid of' that allows parts of you to transform and metabolize into the power and grace you long to feel. My job is to help you navigate this journey and learn the skills to be your own captain; to help you see how much choice you actually have. I help clients to heal, deepen, and improve their most important relationship: the relationship with yourself. When all parts of you are welcomed and engaged with, a wholeness can emerge in which you more regularly experience compassion, calmness, courage, and clarity towards yourself and others. I am a long time meditator and student of yoga and Buddhism. With clients, I utilize practices from Tibetan Buddhism as well as Internal Family Systems and Gestalt therapy. My approach is also informed by earth and indigenous based wisdoms. These are the foundations of my embodied, experiential psychotherapy approach.",

We work to bring the hidden into light. That which has caused you to distort your inner strength can be brought to the foreground and choices can be made. I embrace all gender expressions and sexual orientations. I have experience supporting a variety of relationship configurations and lifestyles, and can assist in navigating issues that can surface in these choices, such as boredom, jealousy, intimacy blockages, differing needs and desires, sexual and emotional satisfaction. Influenced by the works of Fritz Perls, Wilhelm Reich and Rollo May, I will help you explore what has been fed to you and become indigestible. We will work to move through the layers of pain towards a new, authentic expression of Self. I believe that we are continually remaking and creating ourselves and our experiences. Sometimes we do this without awareness, and suffer from self-deception and distortion.The goal is for you to become aware of what you are doing, how you are doing it, and how you can change.",

            "blurb": "I am well aware of how uneasy it can feel to search for a therapist for the first time. I am a therapist, yes, but I pride myself on being a real person. My approach is down to earth, compassionate and non-judgmental. I specialize in Women's Mental Health, and see many clients struggling with anxiety and difficult life phase changes. Every woman deserves a space where she is enough, a space where she can simply be. My goal is to help you create and maintain a loving, accepting relationship with yourself. Additionally, I enjoy working with those in the helping professions (teacher, social worker, nurse etc.) who may be experiencing compassion fatigue or secondary trauma. Visit my blog to get to know me: http://mclaughlintherapy.com/blog.html Are you ready to start the journey toward lasting change and wellness?

Body, mind, spirit, heart, and imagination all hold importance in my work. I believe freedom and fulfillment come from the experience of a full spectrum of feelings. Fear, love, grief, anger, sadness, jealousy, joy, and reverence all hold significance inside of us. By making space for all of our feelings, we become intimate with ourselves. What you celebrate about yourself, the hidden or unclaimed parts of yourself, and everything in between have a place in therapy. Together, we become familiar with all of who you are. This is a collaborative process. Past wounding and trauma can make it difficult to be yourself. Some feelings are so painful that we avoid them at all cost; others seem to dominate everything. In therapy, you get to decide what is right for you. As we slow down and tune into what is real for you in each moment, we bring focus and mindfulness to your experiences. Your own unique voice emerges. Together we begin to untangle the threads that keep you from the full capacity of yourself.",

Because of this, many individuals and couples find it to be enjoyable, and very relieving. Of course, since people do therapy to work on painful things, therapy itself isn't always easy. But at least things can be approached thoughtfully and skillfully, in a safe context, and this itself brings great benefits. I work to help you to settle in with yourself, so that you can relate to your life from the deepest, most genuine place possible. Together, we can consider how you relate to yourself and to others - after all, our relationships with ourselves and with others are central to the quality of our lives. I find that from this kind of conversation skillful responses to inner concerns and relationship difficulties arise. I am very experienced at helping people with relationship problems or lack of relationships, anxiety, sadness and depression, with patterns of self-criticism and difficulty relaxing, history of trauma.",

I am a psychologist with extensive training and experience in helping individuals work through a variety of challenges. I especially enjoy working with adults who are experiencing issues such as relationship problems, anxiety, depression, work/school stress, transitions, low self-esteem, family conflict, perfectionism, and performance concerns. I recently worked as a psychologist at Stanford University and UCSF where I saw students for personal and academic concerns. My clinical training includes work at several college counseling centers, residential treatment facilities, and children's hospitals. Using a supportive and collaborative approach, my goal is to help people grow and overcome challenges so that they can enjoy a healthier, more satisfying life. I primarily draw from cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and mindfulness-based therapies, and my approach is tailored to best fit the needs of each individual. It can be difficult to find someone you can trust. You can feel confident knowing that I have experience working with a variety of issues, and offer a warm and nonjudgmental space for you to explore your most challenging issues.

Being mindful of how societal attitudes about success, gender, age, class, religion, ethnicity, sexuality, body image and relationships impact our experience of life helps guide the work. In a supportive environment I work with individuals as they explore and learn to live their life, in their own context, in their own way. My approach to therapy is to integrate specific techniques from different modalities, based on the needs and desires of the individual. Some of the therapeutic modalities in which I am trained include Solution Focused Therapy, Person Centered Counseling, Cognitive Therapy, Narrative Therapy, Behavioral Therapy and Family Therapy. I am originally from Australia, and have lived in the Bay Area for the past 20 years. Over the past twenty years I have worked with individuals, couples, families and adolescents. These clients were often struggling with a range of concerns including relationship concerns, life transitions, anxiety, depression and drug/substance abuse.",

I have experience treating a wide variety of psychological and emotional difficulties with psychotherapy and medication when appropriate. In my practice I offer psychotherapy and medication evaluation/management to patients who are already in therapy. I have training in several modalities of psychotherapy including Psychodynamic, Interpersonal, and Emotionally Focused Couples/Family Therapy. I aim to help clients be present to their emotional experiences and develop insight into their psychological functioning. I have a special interest in women's mental health, particularly issues around pregnancy and motherhood.

My personal style is the integration of problem-solving techniques with empathetic psychotherapy and a touch of humor. We also have the option of using art as a tool to further your search for meaning and resolution. I have always been a passionate advocate for the alternative sexualities, and enjoy helping you explore your relationships. I welcome clients of all backgrounds, sexual orientations, and gender identities/fluctuations. I believe that through the power of human connection we can heal wounds, forge new paths, and examine ourselves fearlessly. I graduated from Notre Dame de Namur University in 2012 with M.A. in Marriage and Family Therapy (MFT) and Art Therapy. I've since worked with a huge range of clients and am deeply humbled by the vulnerability and courage that people bring to therapy and share with me.",

I work interactively and collaboratively to support you at your pace while helping you move toward the fullest expression of the life you wish to lead. I provide a safe holding environment where the changes you hope for can occur. The therapeutic relationship is the backdrop for investigation and integration, with openness, curiosity, and tenderness. With greater awareness and non-judgement, your capacity for self-acceptance expands. Ultimately this extends out to others in your life and propels you into a more satisfying and harmonious existence. In my work with families, I focus on strengthening the parent-child relationship. I provide developmental guidance and help attach new meanings to behavior, helping parents find new ways of responding and relating to their children. In my work with adults, I help individuals participate more fully in their life's unfolding by making more conscious choices to embody the life they wish to lead.",

I am a calm and grounded person, and this makes my clients feel supported and safe. My work as a therapist is supported by training in the Hakomi method, as well as my life experience and 40 years of Buddhist practice. I will support you in developing greater self-awareness as well as balance of body-mind-spirit. You may find yourself stuck in old patterns, following familiar paths that no longer lead where you want to go. New paths may be less familiar and more work, requiring you to clear away rocks and branches. It can be helpful to have a guide - someone who is holding the map, the flashlight, and who has your back. I can be that guide, supporting you in moving along new paths. New paths can lead to improved relationships, greater self esteem, reduced anxiety, and healing from trauma. Our work can bring more satisfaction and enjoyment into your life. Feel free to contact me for a brief initial phone consultation. I see clients during the week and on Saturdays.",

I might help you to: Discover and release emotional and relational wounds; Alleviate depression, hopelessness, anxiety or mood instability; Face life transitions in employment, relationships, health or aging; Deal with loss and grief; Resolve issues with drug and alcohol dependence; Navigate parenting issues from infancy through young adulthood; Develop more satisfying communication and intimacy in relationships and deepen your relationship with yourself, emerging from dissatisfaction to find fulfillment. I can help you heal the tendency toward self-criticism and blame that is an obstacle to your growth. Your innate capacities for love, joy, intimacy, courage and strength can emerge once emotional injuries are given kind attention and room for change in the therapeutic relationship. I love seeing both individuals and couples. I am trained in depth and relational psychology, and have practiced psychotherapy in San Francisco for 25 years. My work is also informed by meditation; as a student of the Diamond Approach; and a parent for 28 years. I welcome people of any gender and sexual orientation.",

            "blurb": "As a therapist I believe each person has the capability and potential of living outside the bounds of fear, anxiety, apathy, and/or depression if they so desire. I see my role as both collaborator and guide, bearing witness to my client's stories and helping grow insight so new, more empowering stories might be written. I do this using several techniques including changing maladaptive, deeply ingrained thinking/feeling/behavior patterns, and exploring challenging childhood, family, and relationship history. I have experience treating issues of anxiety, depression, destructive relationship patterns, and clients with painful spiritual experiences they want assistance healing. While I have a range of experience, my specialty involves work with individual, single adults who have experienced trauma or challenge in their dating lives and/or carry pain associated with the unmet desire to be married. This starting point often leads to deep exploration of family and childhood history.",

How you respond to these emotions is what makes all the difference and can dictate whether you sink and struggle or thrive and grow. Amazingly, it is by facing and bringing love to what you wish you could 'get rid of' that allows parts of you to transform and metabolize into the power and grace you long to feel. My job is to help you navigate this journey and learn the skills to be your own captain; to help you see how much choice you actually have. I help clients to heal, deepen, and improve their most important relationship: the relationship with yourself. When all parts of you are welcomed and engaged with, a wholeness can emerge in which you more regularly experience compassion, calmness, courage, and clarity towards yourself and others. I am a long time meditator and student of yoga and Buddhism. With clients, I utilize practices from Tibetan Buddhism as well as Internal Family Systems and Gestalt therapy. My approach is also informed by earth and indigenous based wisdoms. These are the foundations of my embodied, experiential psychotherapy approach.",

We work to bring the hidden into light. That which has caused you to distort your inner strength can be brought to the foreground and choices can be made. I embrace all gender expressions and sexual orientations. I have experience supporting a variety of relationship configurations and lifestyles, and can assist in navigating issues that can surface in these choices, such as boredom, jealousy, intimacy blockages, differing needs and desires, sexual and emotional satisfaction. Influenced by the works of Fritz Perls, Wilhelm Reich and Rollo May, I will help you explore what has been fed to you and become indigestible. We will work to move through the layers of pain towards a new, authentic expression of Self. I believe that we are continually remaking and creating ourselves and our experiences. Sometimes we do this without awareness, and suffer from self-deception and distortion.The goal is for you to become aware of what you are doing, how you are doing it, and how you can change.",

We offer a warm, compassionate, and collaborative environment, and will work with you to tailor clinical interventions to fit your needs and goals. Our philosophy is of utilizing evidence-based interventions for mood disorders in working with you. By doing so, our work is based upon providing skills and tools that have been proven to be effective. We will collaboratively set measurable treatment goals with you. Our approach integrates different evidence-based therapeutic approaches, such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Mindfulness, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. These are active, practical, skills-based and engaged forms of therapy--which focus on making positive changes in one's current life.",

My approach is down to earth, compassionate and non-judgmental. I specialize in Women's Mental Health, and see many clients struggling with anxiety and difficult life phase changes. Every woman deserves a space where she is enough, a space where she can simply be. My goal is to help you create and maintain a loving, accepting relationship with yourself. Additionally, I enjoy working with those in the helping professions (teacher, social worker, nurse etc.) who may be experiencing compassion fatigue or secondary trauma.

Body, mind, spirit, heart, and imagination all hold importance in my work. I believe freedom and fulfillment come from the experience of a full spectrum of feelings. Fear, love, grief, anger, sadness, jealousy, joy, and reverence all hold significance inside of us. By making space for all of our feelings, we become intimate with ourselves. What you celebrate about yourself, the hidden or unclaimed parts of yourself, and everything in between have a place in therapy. Together, we become familiar with all of who you are. This is a collaborative process. Past wounding and trauma can make it difficult to be yourself. Some feelings are so painful that we avoid them at all cost; others seem to dominate everything. In therapy, you get to decide what is right for you. As we slow down and tune into what is real for you in each moment, we bring focus and mindfulness to your experiences. Your own unique voice emerges. Together we begin to untangle the threads that keep you from the full capacity of yourself.",

Because of this, many individuals and couples find it to be enjoyable, and very relieving. Of course, since people do therapy to work on painful things, therapy itself isn't always easy. But at least things can be approached thoughtfully and skillfully, in a safe context, and this itself brings great benefits. I work to help you to settle in with yourself, so that you can relate to your life from the deepest, most genuine place possible. Together, we can consider how you relate to yourself and to others - after all, our relationships with ourselves and with others are central to the quality of our lives. I find that from this kind of conversation skillful responses to inner concerns and relationship difficulties arise. I am very experienced at helping people with relationship problems or lack of relationships, anxiety, sadness and depression, with patterns of self-criticism and difficulty relaxing, history of trauma.",

I am a psychologist with extensive training and experience in helping individuals work through a variety of challenges. I especially enjoy working with adults who are experiencing issues such as relationship problems, anxiety, depression, work/school stress, transitions, low self-esteem, family conflict, perfectionism, and performance concerns. I recently worked as a psychologist at Stanford University and UCSF where I saw students for personal and academic concerns. My clinical training includes work at several college counseling centers, residential treatment facilities, and children's hospitals. Using a supportive and collaborative approach, my goal is to help people grow and overcome challenges so that they can enjoy a healthier, more satisfying life. I primarily draw from cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and mindfulness-based therapies, and my approach is tailored to best fit the needs of each individual. It can be difficult to find someone you can trust. You can feel confident knowing that I have experience working with a variety of issues, and offer a warm and nonjudgmental space for you to explore your most challenging issues.

My clients struggle with depression, anxiety, loneliness, relationship challenges, questions around life direction, life purpose, personal identity. Often they report feeling \"stuck,\" frustrated in their creative expression or in their ability to change or move forward in their lives. I try to look at each individual's strengths (ask how we can build upon those), and also look at where a person is getting in his or her own way. I try and understand what experiences have helped shaped you, who you are at this particular moment in time, and what directions you hope to move in in the future. I offer weekly or twice weekly psychotherapy sessions. These are dynamic conversations designed to facilitate insight, awareness, and change.",

Many of my clients are highly motivated, achievement-oriented professionals who feel held back or \"stuck.\" Some are dealing with stress and anxiety, some are having trouble finding focus or motivation, and many are trying to clarify their purpose and direction. I help them find a way through these issues--particularly as they show up in the workplace. Like it or not, we spend a huge amount of time and energy at work, so it's important that we spend it well. I understand that therapy is an investment of time and money, and so I use approaches that are time-limited and research-supported, such as CBT. Yet my approach is highly individualized; I help you get clear on what's important to you, so that you can make good decisions. I'm an analytical person, and I'm good at helping people break down thorny issues into manageable pieces. At the same time, I recognize that we are dealing with personal problems that are complicated and sometimes difficult to talk about. So I strive to be authentic, grounded, and nonjudgmental.",

Not only do you have your new (and changing) physical reality, but anxiety, depression and overwhelm can show up unannounced. I've been there! The great news is that, with help, we can transform our state of mind and start loving life again. WE can get YOU back on the road to loving your life--let's get to it! Whether an illness is your own or that of someone close to you, adjusting to new diagnoses, changing symptoms and abilities--sometimes invisible symptoms--can challenge the strongest of us. Clients learn new ways to value and manage emotions and to live fully with all that life brings. Interactive and educational workshops address stress and emotions relative to chronic illness and loss for self-help groups and professional organizations; education and training for counselors and therapists who work with clients with chronic illness.",

The majority of my work is with people who are working to overcome anxiety, depression, relationship problems, job stress, addiction, and life transition concerns that are interfering with their ability to live a more satisfying and fulfilling life. Licensed and trained as a clinical psychologist and a MFT, I work with both individuals and couples, using a collaborative and active approach. In addition to my clinical work, I supervise psychiatric residents and graduates students in psychology. I am on the clinical faculty at UC San Francisco, the staff at California Pacific Medical Center and a provider for Brown and Toland Medical Group.",

Many people come to my practice reporting they find themselves feeling stuck and overwhelmed, with their usual ways of coping with stress in relationships and at work no longer feeling effective. Psychotherapy can provide a space to mindfully explore what might be contributing to our difficulties and offer an opportunity to better understand aspects of oneself, through an exploration of our thoughts feelings, behaviors, memories and dreams. My approach is based in relational psychodynamic psychotherapy. It holds that healing takes place within the context of a relationship. Our early experiences are important in understanding how we tend to think, feel and act in particular situations. Therapy can help people sort through and see themselves more fully. My style is interactive and warm, but also direct and practical. I create a safe and open space to explore your concerns free of judgment. Finding a therapist who is a good fit is the first step. Please contact me so we can decide if my approach feels right.",

I use a holistic mind/body approach to therapy to help you loosen those stuck places, and to feel confident and more fully at ease with yourself and others. Sometimes anxiety and worries can become obstacles to achieving your goals, limiting your experience and potential. You can develop tools to use to get these stuck places moving again and to live with less anxiety. We will work together to help you identify triggers and fears and to understand and disentangle from familial patterns to enable you to experience successful meaningful relationships and joy in your life. We have many resources within us that become neglected and forgotten while other unresolved issues take center stage. I use a holistic strengths based approach that draws from mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, body-awareness, creative, and psychodynamic traditions to help unlock hidden places that prevent you from living a satisfying life. My training includes a specialty in mind/body therapy. I have heard many people say, \"I have talked about this for a long time but nothing ever changes.\" We can work together using verbal as well as mindfulness and sensory awareness to help experience shifts at a deeper level.",

Perhaps, you have been experiencing excessive stress trying to manage family or financial issues, a relationship, or a demanding career. I specialize in stress and anger management, trauma treatment, and mood problems often associated with depression and Bipolar Disorder. My other specialty is aging and issues that often surface when we get older. I work with my senior clients through issues such as anxiety, depression, grief, chronic pain, family problems, or re-discovery of life meaning. My style in therapy has been commented on as warm, caring, approachable, and, yet, direct. Before becoming a psychologist, I was a career coach, teacher, scientist, and a business manager. I lived in other countries. Many clients find my experience with career transitions, corporate environment, and diversity helpful and relevant. Together, we will work on improvements in managing your stress level, emotions, relationships, and career. I offer weekend, morning, and evening hours, and videoconferencing for your convenience. Please email (this is preferable) or call with any questions, including clarification on my practice and accepted insurance, or to schedule an appointment.",

Please call, don't email Early childhood Trauma is more common than you think. If you have anxiety, depression, or addictions these symptoms are often due to childhood trauma.

I work with people who suffer with these symptoms and I have over 15 years of experience treating depression, addictions, anxiety and eating disorders. I have a background in art and have a warm, engaging (rather than silent) style of interacting. My experience includes work at 2 Bay Area eating disorder centers, work as a Mental Health Assessor for UCSF, teaching graduate psychology classes, crisis work for Mental Health Association of NYC & supervision of interns. I teach clients to use meditation & mindfulness tools and work from a holistic view addressing mind, body and spirit. Together, we will work to help you find new meaning and purpose in life. Additionally, I work with couples struggling in their relationship. Also offering creativity coaching for artists, writers, musicians. Finding the right therapist with whom you feel the most comfortable and connected is essential, and therefore, I offer an initial consultation at a reduced fee.

Being mindful of how societal attitudes about success, gender, age, class, religion, ethnicity, sexuality, body image and relationships impact our experience of life helps guide the work. In a supportive environment I work with individuals as they explore and learn to live their life, in their own context, in their own way. My approach to therapy is to integrate specific techniques from different modalities, based on the needs and desires of the individual. Some of the therapeutic modalities in which I am trained include Solution Focused Therapy, Person Centered Counseling, Cognitive Therapy, Narrative Therapy, Behavioral Therapy and Family Therapy. I am originally from Australia, and have lived in the Bay Area for the past 20 years. Over the past twenty years I have worked with individuals, couples, families and adolescents. These clients were often struggling with a range of concerns including relationship concerns, life transitions, anxiety, depression and drug/substance abuse.",
